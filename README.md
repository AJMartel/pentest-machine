pentest-machine
------
Automates some pentesting work via an nmap XML file. As soon as each command finishes it writes its output to the terminal and the files in output-by-service/ and output-by-host/. Runs fast-returning commands first. Please send me protocols/commands/options that you would like to see included.

```
Just run setup.py as root. This will install package prereqs as well as all necessary Python libraries within a virtual environment.
```

Read from Nmap XML file

```sudo ./pentest-machine -x nmapfile.xml```


Perform an Nmap scan with a hostlist then use those results

Skip the patator/dirb bruteforcing and all SIP and HTTP commands

```sudo ./pentest-machine --no-brute -x nmapfile.xml -s sip,http```
